<h1>Painting CLUB</h1>

<body>
<p>At SVECW the late bloomer, Painting Club, has been blooming luxuriously with many activities from 9th July 2012. Painting is a creative art. Basically it is an innate skill and some children at a very early age are found to be good at drawing pictures and painting things around them. If parents can identify and nurture their interest, he or she will become a good painter.
Painting Club aims at encouraging the new talents by identifying students with a zeal. At SVECW, many amateur painters are encouraged to participate in various competitions. Their paintings are exhibited in the campus in various special occasions. Students, being a part of Painting Club utilize every opportunity to fine tune their creative skills.</p>
